# JavaScript Project
- The project is focused on creating, reading, and displaying a JSON file you create yourself. The JSON file should contain a variety of data types.  The display of the data in the JSON file should be done using functions within a .js file referenced from a html file. The project could be built using the following steps. I chose athletes and a summarized biography for my json file. I used fetch API and a loop to display these in the console in the format I wanted. In another js file, I also created 3 functions, displayed them in the console and also in the HTML browser.
